# Type-ahead-Hierarchical-combo

A combobox with two level combotree in it.

###[Demo](https://rawgit.com/kamlekar/Type-ahead-Hierarchical-combo/master/index.html)

###How to filter second level items?
I hardcode colon (`:`) to filter the child level elements. Lets take the following list as an example to load in this combobox.

    - Cars
        - Audi
        - Mercedes
        - Ferrari
    - Bikes
        - Ducati
        - Honda

To select "Ducati", you need to type in search like this `"Bikes:Ducati"`.
